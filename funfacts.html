          <p>Do you add milk to your tea? I don't!</p>
          <p>
            If you are one of those who would like to have their tea with milk,
            do you add the milk first and then the tea or vice versa? Can you tell the difference whether it was the tea or the milk poured into the cup first? 
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>You may be thinking, "what difference does it even make?"</p>
          <p>
            This was the conversation at a tea party in a summer afternoon of the late 1920s, 
            in Cambridge, England. One woman in the party insisted that the tea tasted differently 
            depending on whether tea or the milk was poured into the cup first. 
            It was difficult for her to convince her audience though. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The guests in the party could not conceive of any difference in the chemistry of the 
            two alternative ways. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher" target="_blank">Ronald Aylmer Fisher</a>, who was one of the guests 
            at the time proposed to test the woman's claim. What a fun way to spend a sunny 
            afternoon, you may say!
          </p>
          <p>
            However, many in the party agreed with this and they started to design an experiment. 
            The lady was given cups of tea, without her knowing whether the tea was added first 
            and then the milk, or the milk was added first and then the tea.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the lady was given a single cup of tea, she had a 50% chance of guessing it 
            right even if she could tell the difference by tasting. 
          </p>
          <p>
            If she was given two cups of tea, this probability would remain the same 
            if cups were offered in pairs, each with a different order of mixture. 
            If the cups were not paired, the chances of her getting both cups correct 
            purely by change would be 0.50 x 0.50 = 0.25.  
          </p>
          <p>
            This is still a good chance!
          </p>
          <p>
            How many cups should she try and guess correctly, so that we can 
            confidently say that she is right?! 
            The chances of a correct guess will still remain positive even though it declines with the number of trials. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, if we serve her ten cups of tea, and she fails to correctly 
            identify the mixture in one, could we say that she cannot in fact tell 
            the difference? There is some chance that she may make a mistake if the 
            milk and tea was not mixed well-enough for that cup or if the temperature of 
            the tea was not exactly the same as the other cups. How many false 
            guesses could we accommodate before we conclude that she cannot really tell the difference? 
          </p>
          <p class="green-color">
            These discussions take us to the importance of experimental design, 
            the possibility of random events influencing our outcomes of interest, 
            the probability distributions, and the concept of statistical significance.
