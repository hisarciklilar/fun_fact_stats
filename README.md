# Fun Facts Stats

Fun Fact Stats is a webpage dedicated to break the anxiety around  the learning and application of statistical methods.
Students tend to struggle with statistical concepts. They have pre-set opinions about Statistics, which make them anxious even before starting to learn. Also, in most cases, they perceive statistics to have abstract concepts; it is very hard for them to relate and to see the point of all calculations. 

This website aims to show the learners and users of statistical methods the fun side of statistics. It will achieve this through two means: 

1. Providing fun facts about statistics

  This first item is the focus of this project. 
  
2. Designing online games starting from the very basic and advancing further as understanding improves.

  Although this is integrated into the design, and a placeholder navigatikon item annd a page is included, this will not be actioned within this project. 
  
The inspiration for this page came from the book "Lady Testing Tea: How Statistics Revolutionized Science in the Twentieth Century" by David Salsburg. Hence, the first fun fact on the site is Lady Testing Tea. The aim is to add new stories, new fun facts regularly to keep the users of the website engaged.

## User Experience

The target audience for this website are UG students, although anybody who is interested with statistics is welcomed!

### User Stories

Users of the website expect the following: 

- Be familiar with the page design in term of the placement of the navigation bar items, the social media links, etc. 
- Navigate around the site easily without having the need to search for things.
- Easily read and understand  the information provided in the pages. 
- Can see clearly which statistical concept the fun fact story relates to.

### Site Owner's Goals

I aim to break the anxiety around learning statistics by 

- creating a warm, welcoming page 
- providing users with examples and stories that they can relate to 
- creating a statistics game to help users learn new concepts they as progress (please note this is a plan for a longer time period; it is not covered within these pages)

## Features 

<gr> In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things. </gr>

### Existing Features

#### Favicon

- The normal distribution is chosen as the favicon for this website due to its simplicity, allowing for an easy recognition even when it is tiny. 

- The area under the normal diustribution curve is shaded in red to introduce a greater contrast with the white background and also it is the same color as the "anxious" statistics monster.

#### Navigation Bar

- The navigation bar includes links to five main pages: Home, Fun Facts, Fun Stats, Subscribe, Feeling overwhelmed? 

- The background color of the navigation bar is chosen to be a warm color, gold, to create a positive feeling for the user.

- Similarly, the header fonts (Rock-Salt and Happy Monkey) are  chosen because of their fun-looking style, to match the title. 

- The navigation links open on the same page, except "Feeling overwhelmed?", which opens on a new page. This is because the latter is designed to be an impactful motivational poster, free of any header or footer items. 

#### Fonts

The following fonts are used:  

- "Lexend" for the body and footer text. "Lexend" is chosen for the main text because a small scale study has shown that people can read and understand more easily when this font style is used. I have been using this font in documents that I produce for my students (in my professional role). 

- "Happy Monkey" for headings level 2 and higher. I found this font after a search on keywords "smile", "fun", and "happy" on Google Fonts. Since the page is aiming to the "fun", a font style that would give that effect was preferred. Like "Lexend", "Happy Monkey" is also easy to read, and it is  "fun". It also matches the font style I use for the header ("Rock Salt") 

- "Rock Salt" for heading level 1 (which is the main header of the wage). Choosing the font style for header was the most difficult. Since it serves as the logo to the page, it takes an important role. <gr> I wanted .... it to read easily...  </gr>

- "Jost" for motivational poster page

A few alternative options were considered for the header. 

#### Fonts for the Header

<gr> I have tried alternative logos and fonts for the header. Because the page targets students and aims to help them get familiar with Statistics *help them like statistics), I wanted the header to be fun. (Check  the notes you wrote on notebook) </gr>

Below, I provide screenshots of some alternatives considered. 

- Google Fonts

<gr>
- The webpage that I used
The webpage did in fact produce something very close to what I wanted. Also, I managed to align the fonts so that they resemble (to follow) a normal distribution. But I dis not use this in the end, because the text was created as a link to an image, which was not as practical as working with fonts and text.  
</gr>

#### Landing page

- Landing page includes images of two cute fluffy monsters. 
  - The grumpy-looking red monster (anxious monster) represents the anxiety around statistics and how people perceive it to be scary. Although it is perceived to be scary, it actually is not. 
  - The fluffy blue monster with a smiling face (happy monster) is the real identity of statistics: fun, playful, and <gr> xxx/>

- I wanted the user to see the "real" face of the statistics monster by somehow changing the look of the anxious monster to a happy monster. With the limitations of the html and css, I did this using hoover style. In large screens, hoovering over the anxious monster reveals the real face of it: the happy monster.   

- Inspired by the Code Institute's love-running walk through example, these images are included as background images. Because each of these images also represent a meaning, an alt text for each was added through using hidden images in the div they are located. 

- Through the happy monster, statistics is depected as fun, engaging, playful, and also helping the user to get stronger (i.e. more employable). Each of these characteristics are linked to a page:
  - _fun_ links to "fun facts" page
  - _engaging_ links to "subscribe" page (note: this is not a perfect match, and will need to be revisited in the future)
  - _playful_ links to "fun stats" page
  - makes you _stronger_ links to "motivational" page.

- The color of text linked to these pages changes to pink when user hovers on large screens 

#### Fun facts page

- This page aims to show learners of statistics some interesting facts about statistics by revealing where (or under which circumstances) the most commonly used statistical concepts originate from. 

- At the moment, there is a single story under this page. The intention is  to develop it further, adding more interesting facts over time. In that case, the "fun facts" page will have a list of topics and links to corresponding pages while each fun-fact story will be provided in a different page. 

- Considering the structure described above, the top of the page starts with an informative path to the page (please note that at the moment "fun facts" page is the same as the "lady tasting tea" page, but this will change as more stories are added.)

- Below the path, there is a set of keywords that the fun fact story covers. This will help the users to relate the story with the statistical concepts. 

 

 
#### Fun stats page

- There is a placeholder for this page on the website but the currently the only content is an under-construction-type image. 

- To encourage users to come back to the page, brief information is provided with text "stats game under construction" rather than a general message (which may become very discouraging). 

- It will be an interactive page which aids students in their learning by starting from the basic calculations and moving on to more complicated ones as students progress. 

- It will achive the above objective by creation of a simple interactive statistics game.

#### Motivational poster page

- This is a poster that I created while learning CSS formatting and the Box Model.  

- It is a page on its own right. Therefore it is the only link on the navigation panel that opens on a new page. It does not have a link back to the homepage either. It is self-standing.  

- It shows quite a contrast to other pages on the site, but it is designed to impress and take the whole attention to the message. 

- It is a reminder for everybody: learners of all subjects, people working towards their targets, and myself. 

- I used two alternative, but similar images for this page. An image in portrait view loads for mobile phone users while another image with a landscape view loads for tablets and gadgets with larger screens.  

### Features to be Added

- The Fun Stats pages which provides an interactive learning environment 

- Addition of more fun fact stories 
  - The next story will be on the t-distribution and how statisticians of the Guinness beer factory came with the idea.

- Addition of a search button for users to search for relevant concepts

- Adding labels to all form elements to ensure full accessibility. 

## Testing 

### Validation of Code

For html files, I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) and for the cc file, I used  [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

- All three html pages (landing page, fun facts page, subscribe page) are without errors

- The css file is without error. There is one warning about the "Jost" Google font import.

### Lighthouse

#### Landing Page

My index page had an accessibility score of 85%. I followed the steps below to increase it to 100%: 

- I changed the seagreen color that I used for linked text under the happy monster image into #20643F, which provides a better contrast with the white background. 
- I increased the font size for the above-mentioned links
- I changed the color of the text at the very bottom of the footer to a darker color (#154229)
- I added aria-label link text to the links below the happy monster mentioned above
- I added aria-label link text to the links in the navigation bar items 

    ![](./media_readme/Accessibility_index.png)

#### Fun Facts Page

The initial accessibility score was 90%. I followed the steps below to increase it to 100%:

- The path to the page I provided at the top of the fun facts page was in color #807575. This did not provide enough contract. I changed it to #554E4E. 

- I added a title to the Wikipedia iframe.

  ![](./media_readme/Accessibility_fun_facts.png)

#### Subscribe Page

The initial accessibility score was 86%. I followed the steps below to increase it to 91%:

- To obtain sufficient contrast, I changed seagreen color on the submit and reset buttons to #21643E
- I added aria-label and aria-labelby texts to form elements, but I there are still a couple of labels to be added. I will need to read about how to do those before I could make a change.

### Wave Webaim - accessibility testing
You can test your site for accessibility through the wave.webaim site - it needs to be deployed in order for it to test it. Fix any errors that it gives

### Manual Testing

You need to perform, and document everything you did to manually test your site.
At a minimum - you need to check every link on every page works as intended.
So that is check every link in the nav bar (do this on every single page because its a link in a different file) and any other links that appear on your site.
Test the responsiveness of the site - you can do this in the dev tools in responsive mode.
You should also load the site once deployed on as many devices you have access to. What is different from one device to the next? why is it different?

Test the user stories that you created earlier in the readme - did you satisfy the goal, how?

To write up the tests you can use a table,
| Feature being tested | Expected Outcome | Testing Performed | Actual Outcome | Result (Pass or fail) |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | enter details here | <- duplicate this line for each line you need

You should have tests for every section of every page.. individually.

### Font Color

- I used the [Color Contrast Analyzer](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/color-contrast) to find the right replacement for the colors that failed the contrast test during Lighthouse checks. 

### Hidden images

- The idea of using hidden images to be able to use alt text is taken from Oliver Hall's explanation on Content Forest: [Question: How to add alt text for a background image in HTML/CSS?](https://contentforest.com/faq/how-to-add-alt-text-for-background-image).

### Form

- The examples provided in the love-running walkthrough example and the Coders Coffeehouse pages were very helpful. I changed these and applied my own coding, but I learned a lot from these examples durind the process. 

- The checkbox margins are set using the post by [Suraj Parise's post on stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54003551/how-to-do-the-spacing-between-checkboxes-and-values) [Accessed on 14 September 2024].

- I got the idea of directing the form response to a "thank you for subscribing"" page from my mentor, Matt Bodden.

### Code formatting

- I used VS Code's "Prettier Code Formatting" extension to finalise the formatting of the html code.
- I used VS Code's "Beautify" css formatting extension to finalise the formatting of the css code. 

## Acknowledgements
